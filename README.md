### Hi there 👋

🌱 I am a Ph.D. candidate in **School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, China**. I am a member of [Intelligent Media Analysis Group (IMAG)](https://imag-njust.net/) and advised by [Prof. Jinshan Pan](https://jspan.github.io/). Not long ago, I was an intern at Tencent AI Lab, working closely with [Di Kang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=2ztThPwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Linchao Bao](https://linchaobao.github.io/).

🔭 My research interest includes image/video super-resolution restoration and enhancement, deblurring, dehazing and other restoration tasks. Recently, I am experimenting with face editing, 3D face reconstruction, and related tasks.
